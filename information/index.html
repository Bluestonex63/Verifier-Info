                <p>Every Saturday, <strong>the least active verifier</strong> between those who did less than 20 verified runs in a week (see exclusions) <strong>will be removed from the team.</strong>
                    <p></p>
                    <strong>Bonus Points:</strong><br>
                    All verifiers who achieved over 100 verified runs in a week (no rejections) will gain 1 Bonus Point for each 100 verified runs. You can use 1 bonus point to avoid being removed, more privileges to come such as the dha shop to redeem steam keys!
                    <p></p> 
                    <strong>Exclusions:</strong><br>
                    Super Mods / Admins are excluded. Verifiers who achieve 1000 verifications in total (not counting rejections) will be promoted to actual Moderators and will gain immunity for their contribution.
                    <p></p>
                    <strong>Justifications and contribution:</strong><br>
                    If you are on vacation or busy with anything for a certain period, you are justified. The justification period that is tolerated is proportional to your contribution. If you are contributing in other ways (e.g. creating tools, being active as a discord mod, helping the server and other people) you don't have to worry, you won't be removed.</p>

                Many runners submit No Coin Keys in the wrong category (Key), just move them to the correct category. Also make sure to check for 3 revives maximum, if the player revives more, run ends at fourth death (when the revive costs 8 keys, the run is over). <p></p>

                <strong>If you verify a web run</strong>, make sure to set both Version and Platform to Web (uncheck emu, "web emu" doesn't exist). <p></p>

                <strong>When the end of the run is at the very end of the video</strong>, if you are advancing frame by frame it might look like the end is missing, but if you play the video normally you might be able to see the last frame. In this case, let the video end normally and THEN copy debug info while in the black screen (or ending screen).<p></p>

                All Top 10 runs in the No Coins category, and Top 3 in Coins, Score, and All Powerups categories will be required to show 10 seconds of game-play footage from their previous attempt and, most importantly, you need to start another run right after the attempt is concluded and play for at least 10 more seconds. If the run doesn't have the 10 seconds before and after, it will be required to reject the run and ask the person to re-upload. If the recording doesn't have 10 seconds after at all, it will be required that the runner uploads the whole session of attempts, he can link it as a separate video in the description of the run for additional proof.<p></p>

                <strong>Do not touch "Edit Game" and "Edit Theme"</strong>. You are all verifiers but have mod role to speed up the verification process. If you touch something you will be instantly kicked from the verifiers team and depending on the gravity it's possible that you are getting banned from speedrun.com<br>
                <image src="https://imgur.com/Q271EYt.png" height="60"></image> <p></p>
                <strong>Top 50 runs (no coins)</strong> requires to show the runner press start. 50+ runs that doesn't show pressing start, as long as the starting cutscene is still going, are acceptable. Timer start at 0. Would be nice if you put a mod note. Same if the run doesn't show the end but you can see that the end of the run is about to happen.<p></p>

                <strong>Top 25 runs (no coins)</strong> requires audio, top 10 for other categories.<p></p>

                <strong>Top 25 runs (no coins)</strong> on emulator requires fps counter to be shown on screen and fps capped at 60, top 10 for other categories.<p></p>

                <strong>Top 5 runs (no coins)</strong> and top runs in other categories must be checked by multiple moderators, link the run in the verifiers chat.<p></p>

                <strong>Key Category:</strong><br>
                Many runners submit No Coin Keys in the wrong category (Key), just move them to the correct category. Also make sure to check for 3 revives maximum, if the player revives more, run ends at fourth death (when the revive costs 8 keys, the run is over).<p></p>

                <strong>When you die but the hud doesn't disappear.</strong> This can happen in some older versions, in this case, timer ends when the revive popup appears <br>
